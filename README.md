## Know issues
Due to the implementation of some tricks of initial placement of the window in the desired location on the screen and suppression of the  initial animation with replacement of its own, it may not always work correctly.

## P.S.
Developed for usage [tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix) on wayland but can manage almost any application.
